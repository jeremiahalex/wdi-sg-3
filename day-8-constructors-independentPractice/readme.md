## Create your own - Independent Practice (15 mins)

You are going to take over the Javascript world with a new army of Soldier objects.

- Create a new soldier constructor function that allows you to create soldiers
- A soldier should be able to have a `name` and `number`
- The default type of a solder should be `foot-soldier`
- The soldier's `number` should sequentially increase
- Each soldier in the army should have the same battleCry, an alert of "FREEDOM!"
- Your army should have a general who's type is `general`
- Your general's number should be incremented inline with your foot-solders
